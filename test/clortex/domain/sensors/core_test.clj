"The first line lists the field names for the data in the file. These field names are referenced elsewhere
when specifying the field(s) which need to be predicted, or the encoders to use for that field. The second
line describes the type fo each field (in Python terms). The third line is OPF-specific. `S` (referring to 
the `gym` field) indicates that this field, when it changes, indicates a new **sequence** of data records.
The `T` (for the `timestamp` field) indicates that this field is to be treated as time-series data. These two
concepts are important in powering the CLA's sequence learning.
